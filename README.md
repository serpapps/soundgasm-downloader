## Why Soundgasm Downloader

Soundgasm is designed for listening in the browser. Recordings play through an embedded audio player, but most pages do not provide a clear download button or a simple export workflow. If you want a local copy of a recording you are allowed to save, the usual alternatives are awkward: inspect the page source, hunt for direct media URLs, paste links into third-party sites, or record the browser output in real time.

Soundgasm Downloader removes that friction. The extension focuses on the active Soundgasm page, detects supported audio sources exposed to the browser, and lets you save the recording as a normal file on your computer. The goal is a cleaner workflow for offline listening and personal archiving without leaving the browser.

## Features

- Automatic detection for supported Soundgasm audio pages
- One-click download flow from the extension popup
- Output as MP3 or M4A depending on the original hosted file
- Filename handling based on available page and track details
- Progress feedback while longer recordings download
- Browser-native saving through your normal Downloads folder
- No external converter website or desktop recorder required
- Cross-browser support for Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Firefox, and compatible Chromium browsers

## How It Works

1. Install the extension from the latest release.
2. Open Soundgasm in your browser.
3. Navigate to a supported user recording page.
4. Let the audio player and page content load.
5. Click the extension icon to open the popup.
6. Review the detected audio item.
7. Start the download and save the file locally.
8. Open the saved MP3 or M4A from your Downloads folder.

## Step-by-Step Tutorial: How to Download Soundgasm Audio

1. Install Soundgasm Downloader from the latest GitHub release.
2. Open a Soundgasm recording page in a supported browser.
3. Wait for the page's audio player to load. If the recording has not initialized yet, press play briefly so the browser can see the audio source.
4. Click the Soundgasm Downloader extension button.
5. Confirm that the popup shows the detected recording.
6. Click Download.
7. Wait for the progress indicator to finish.
8. Find the saved audio file in your browser's Downloads folder.

## Supported Formats

- Input: Supported Soundgasm hosted audio files
- Output: MP3 or M4A, preserving the source format where possible

The extension does not promise higher quality than the source provides. Saved files are intended to match the audio available from the Soundgasm page.

## Who It's For

- ASMR listeners who want offline access to favorite recordings
- Creators backing up their own Soundgasm uploads
- Users with unreliable internet access who prefer local playback
- Researchers and students collecting audio samples they have permission to save
- Anyone who wants a browser-based alternative to manual URL extraction

## Common Use Cases

- Save a favorite ASMR recording before traveling
- Back up your own Soundgasm uploads to a local drive
- Keep personal audio references organized outside the browser
- Revisit recordings later without streaming them every time
- Avoid third-party converter sites when saving audio you have rights to download

## Troubleshooting

**The extension does not detect audio**  
Refresh the Soundgasm page, wait for the player to finish loading, and try playing the recording briefly before opening the popup.

**The download does not start**  
Check that your browser allows downloads from extensions and that the recording is accessible in the current tab.

**The file name looks generic**  
Some pages expose limited metadata. Rename the file after download if the page does not provide enough title or uploader detail.

**The saved quality is lower than expected**  
The extension saves the audio source made available by Soundgasm. It cannot create a higher-quality file than the hosted recording.
